                <p>I have gained a couple years of experience 
                with graphic design by doing a variety of 
                projects for my graphics class. In our last year 
                of the class, us students actually got the opportunity to 
                fill the design requests of other teachers.
                I wish to expand on that now and begin to challenge 
                myself more by freelancing. I have made vinyl 
                sticker designs, posters, t-shirt 
                designs, lanyards, small illustrations 
                for myself, but I would be willing to try any request 
                made. </p>

                <h2>projects.</h2>
                <p>Along with graphic design, I also have some basic knowledge of web design. 
                Below are a few web projects that I have made. 
                My favorite would have to be the car one where I 
                messed around with an SVG.</p>
